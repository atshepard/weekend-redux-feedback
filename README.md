# Feedback Form

This feedback form is designed to create a space for daily self-reflection. 

## Description

There were quite a few hurdles to getting this app running the way I envisioned: 

- I tried to refactor the handleClick function multiple ways, but just couldn't get it to work as a separate component. We haven't done that yet, and I just couldn't quite get there on my own. I did have an iteration of the app where I passed it on props, but that was as inelegant as the current solution, in my opinion.


- I also would have liked to refactor the feelings, understanding and support pages to be the same component because they behave so similarly. We haven't discussed in-depth the process of generic componentizing, and unfortunately I did not have the capacity during this sprint to do the research for it.
